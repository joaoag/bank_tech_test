Tech Week Challenge: Bankify
=================

As part of week 10 at Makers I'll be making a very simple command line interface banking app in Ruby

Features from the Makers Brief:
-------

```
  
User stories 

As a customer
So that I don't have to carry around cash
I want a bank account

As a customer
So that I can increase my balance
I want to deposit money in my account

As a customer
So that I can pay for things
I want to make withdrawals from my account

As a customer
So that I can review my finances
I want to know when I made deposits and withdrawals

```



Features spec:
------

### Requirements

* You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console.  (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

_Normal Requirements:_ achieved apart from three line limit warnings

_Additional Requirements:_ achieved

_Strict Requirements:_ achieved apart from loc limit for classes by four 

**Normal Requirements**

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

Testing:
  * Started with a feature test 
  * All tests passing
  * Test coverage high (currently 100%)
  * Unit tests mock the dependencies of the object they are testing

Readability:
  * Rubocop - only three warnings for line length
  * Variable, method, & class names clear and descriptive (see Rubocop warnings...)
  * Can offer simple explanation of how the program works
  "The program tracks deposits and withdrawals, the date they were made and the resulting balance. Using this stored information, it can also print out a statement showing the account history. It's made of three classes: Statement, Transaction and Account"

README & Commits:
  * Describes how to install dependencies, run tests, and run the project
  * Describes my approach
  * Describes how I structured my code and why
  * Includes a screenshot of your running app
  * Has reasonable spelling & grammar

  * Commit messages clearly describe what that commit does

Design:
* Classes adhere to single responsibility principle:
    
    Account: Keeps track of account history (withdrawals, deposits, balance, dates of these)

    Statement: Outputs account history into console table

    Transaction: Carries value of transaction and transaction date information to Account

    _For future:_
    I would split Statement into FormatStatement and PrintStatement

* Each method & class is (almost) as small as possible (see above)

Common Problems Avoided:
 One or two classes that do all the work <br/>
 One class is significantly longer than all of the others <br/>
 Most methods don't return anything, instead they modify instance variables<br/>
 The feature tests don't use a test framework (e.g. RSpec or Jasmine)<br/>
 The decimal points are missing on the end of the numbers<br/>
 The tests only pass today, because the dates aren't mocked or passed in as arguments<br/>
 Transaction is abbreviated to `trans` or `txn`<br/>
 A Transaction class that has a method that prints itself<br/>



**Additional Requirements:**

Testing:
  * Where possible always testing for behaviour, rather than state
  * Test descriptions read clearly
  * Make appropriate use of the testing framework's methods to keep your test code clean ('let' and 'context' blocks used - to be used 'subject')


Design:
  * Each method is fewer than 7 lines
  * Classes are fewer than 50 lines
  * Clear separation between your program logic and output (Eg for Ruby: only calling `puts` once in the program)

    
**Strict Requirements:**

Testing:
  * Project commit history clearly show evidence of a thorough TDD process
  * Mocked the dependency Time, tests would pass if ran at any point in the future


Readability:
  * Line lengths are _not_ fewer than 80 characters. Longest in production code is 82. Longest in test files is 171 (!)

Design:
  * Program has at least three classes that I can reasonably justify
  * Methods are all fewer than 5 lines (excluding keyword `end` and `def` name)
  * Classes are _not_ fewer than 30 lines (excluding keyword `end` and `def` name). Longest class is 34 lines.
  * Program mostly uses appropriate data structures to hold the necessary values your program needs. Ideally I would convert the @headers value into a symbol 




Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
-----
I've decided my MVP will be the back end functionality of the balance, credit and debit behaviour.

After finishing this I will implement the display requirements.



Approach:
-----

* Create UML sequence and diagrams based on the user stories

* Decide on order user stories will be met

* Create branch for new feature, checkout to that branch

* Write a feature test, watch it fail

* Write the code to make it pass

* Refactor

* Make pull request to merge with master branch

* Review changes

* Accept / make change requests

* Merge branch with master

* Repeat this until the MVP is met


Program Structure:
-----

The Account class is responsible for monitoring the account history. It has methods for making withdrawals and deposits and keeping track of the dates on which they were made and the balance that resulted from these transactions.

The Statement class is responsible for outputting this information into the format described in the 'Acceptance Criteria' section above.

There are no dependencies between the classes.


Outcome:
-----

* Everything created using strict TDD (all tests passing, 100% test coverage)

* Practised Git workflow, working on specific branches for each feature before merging back into master (committing with each significant piece of work finished) 

* First four user stories met



Improvements:
-----




Technologies used
-------

* RSpec
* Ruby
* Rubocop
* Travis CI



## How to use bank_tech_test ##

System requirements
-------

* Ruby 2.5.0
* Mac OS X
* Chrome browser



### Set up ###

1. clone the repo<br/>
Under the repo name click *clone or download*<br/>
Click on *use HTTPs*, copy the clone URL of the repo<br/>
In the terminal go on the working directory where you want to clone the project<br/>
Use the `git clone` command and paste the clone URL then press enter :

```shell
$ git clone 
```

2. On your local machine go inside of the *bank_tech_test* directory :

```shell
$ cd bank_tech_test
```
3. To install all the *gems* contained in the *Gemfile*, install and run *Bundle* :
Install :

```shell
$ install bundle
```
Run:

```shell
$ bundle
```
4. You can see the different directories, with the `ls` command.


```

### Run the tests ###

1. Check that the codes are passing the test. From the root *bank_tech_test* directory, run the *spec*.<br/>
You can check all the files in one go:

```shell
$ cd bank_tech_test
$ rspec
```
To check only one file at a time :

```shell
$ cd bank_tech_test
$ rspec spec/file_name_spec.rb
```

2. Check that the code respects the quality of the *Rubocop* guideline, by running `rubocop` from the *bank_tech_test* directory :

```shell
$ cd bank_tech_test
$ rubocop
```

## Run the app ##

1. On the command line, from the root directory *bank_tech_test*, use the `irb` command :

```shell
$ cd bank_tech_test
$ irb
```
2. Follow the steps below to create an account, a statement, withdraw and deposit amounts and output the result of these to the console.
